    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_notes'
    ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler

    ```ruby
    bundle install
    ```

3. Copy & run migrations

    ```ruby
    bundle exec rails g spree_notes:install
    ```

4. Restart your server!


  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Configure New Class As Noteable

1. Added association for notes to new class

    ```ruby
      has_many :notes, as: :notable
    ```

2. For adding additional options for noteables, we can override the method `noteable_klasses` from `Spree::NoteHelper`

    ```ruby
      def noteable_klasses
        legacy_klasses = super
        legacy_klasses << Spree::NewKlass
      end
    ```
4. For adding sidebar tab of notes, feel free to create deface override with [reference][1].
5. Add `notes.html.erb` as view template for new class with [reference][2].

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle update
bundle exec rake
```


When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_notes/factories'
```
